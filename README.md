# Beautiful Racket

This repository contains the code I'm writing while working through the 
[Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com) book.


## Prerequisites

To run the code, you'll need to have Racket installed (which will already be
the case if you use the devShell in the `flake.nix`). You'll also need to 
install the `beautiful-racket` package, which you can do with:

```sh
$ raco pkg install --auto beautiful-racket
```

(It's probably possible to do that automatically in the devShell, but who has
the time?)
